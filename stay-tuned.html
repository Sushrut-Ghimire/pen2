            <h1>Stay Tuned for "The Democratic Papers"</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Being the avid believer of democracy that i am and witnessing the current state of my country where people are misinterpreting the problems created by the wrong people in power as the broblems created by democracy really frightens me. Also the fact that there seems to be a growing population calling for the return of the wretchedly medieval practice of monarchy is a matter of concern as well. So, I decided to write this book entitled "The Democratic Papers" which consists of 20 essays collectively defending the system of democracy in Nepal. The book itself is in its final stages of completion so stay tuned for it to come out.</p>
